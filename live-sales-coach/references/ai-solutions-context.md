# AI Solutions — Product Context & Selling Framework

Use this reference to understand the product being sold and how to position it during live calls.

## What We Sell

**AI Employees** — autonomous AI agents that handle real business functions:
- **AI Sales Rep** — handles outreach, follow-ups, lead qualification, appointment booking
- **AI Marketing Agent** — creates content, manages campaigns, runs social media, email marketing
- **AI Operations Assistant** — data entry, reporting, process automation, customer support triage
- **AI Growth Agent** — market research, competitive analysis, lead generation, pipeline building

These aren't chatbots or simple automations. They're AI workers that learn your business context, execute tasks independently, and improve over time.

## Pricing Structure
- Range: $500 — $1,500/month per AI employee
- Minimum commitment: 3-4 months
- Strategy: Land with one use case, expand as results prove out

## Target Customer Profile
- Small to mid-size businesses (10-200 employees)
- Already have some digital presence but are doing too much manually
- Often skeptical about AI but curious
- Budget-conscious — need to see clear ROI before committing
- Decision-makers: owners, VPs, directors who are frustrated with the pace of growth

## Core Value Proposition

The core angle is **loss aversion** — customers are losing money every day because they're NOT using AI properly.

Frame it as: "You're not paying for AI. You're paying to stop bleeding money on manual work that a machine should be handling."

### Pain Points to Uncover
1. **Time waste** — how many hours per week does the team spend on repetitive tasks?
2. **Missed opportunities** — how many leads go cold because nobody followed up fast enough?
3. **Inconsistency** — is the quality of outreach/marketing/ops dependent on who shows up to work?
4. **Scaling bottleneck** — are they avoiding growth because they can't hire fast enough?
5. **Competitor pressure** — are competitors moving faster because they've automated?

### ROI Talking Points
- One AI employee costs ~$500-1,500/month vs a human at $4,000-8,000/month (fully loaded)
- AI works 24/7 — no sick days, no ramp time, no turnover
- Results compound: the AI learns from every interaction and gets better
- Typical client sees ROI within 30-60 days

### Common Customer Types and Their Concerns

**The Skeptic** — "AI can't do what my people do"
→ Show specific examples. Don't argue. Demo the output side-by-side with what a human produces.

**The Cost-Conscious** — "We don't have budget for this"
→ Reframe: "What's your current cost for [the manual process]? The AI costs a fraction of that."

**The Overwhelmed** — "We're too busy to implement something new"
→ "That's exactly why you need this. You're busy because you don't have enough capacity. The AI adds capacity without adding headcount."

**The DIYer** — "We'll just build it ourselves with ChatGPT"
→ "ChatGPT is a tool. What you need is a worker. There's a difference between having a hammer and having a carpenter."

**The Wait-and-Seer** — "We'll revisit this next quarter"
→ "What changes between now and next quarter? The problem doesn't get smaller. Your competitors don't wait."
