## Discovery Call Structure

A 30-minute discovery call has three chapters:

**Minutes 0-5: Rapport + Agenda**
- Establish credibility in the first 90 seconds (the "90-second rule")
- Use trigger-based rapport or an astute observation — not weather talk
- Set an explicit agenda so the prospect knows what to expect and feels in control

**Minutes 5-25: Discovery (finding problems + building trust)**
- Balance asking questions with giving value back
- Move from technical/process problems UP to business impact
- Use the "give-get" rhythm: share an insight, then ask a deeper question

**Minutes 25-30: The Five-Minute Drill**
- Validate: "Do you want to buy?" (is this deal real?)
- Timeline: "When do you want to buy?" (will this close soon?)
- Process: "How do you buy?" (who else needs to be involved?)

## Opening & Rapport

### Trigger-Based Rapport
Before the call, find something about their business that connects to what you solve. Reference it in the first 90 seconds.

Example: "I was prepping for this and saw you just launched [X]. That caught my eye because most companies at your stage are still doing [Y] manually — the fact that you're already thinking about this tells me you're ahead of the curve."

### The Astute Observation
Point out something specific about their business that shows you did your homework AND understand their world.

Example: "I noticed you're running [specific process] with a team of [N]. Usually companies your size have 2-3x that headcount for that function. You're either incredibly efficient or stretched thin — I'm curious which one it is."

### Setting the Agenda
After rapport, set expectations. Use a permission-based approach:

"Here's what I was thinking for the next 25 minutes. I'd love to understand what's going on in your world, particularly around [area]. I'll share some things we've seen work with similar companies. And if it makes sense, we can talk about what working together might look like. Sound fair?"

---

## Question Frameworks

### The Humbling Disclaimer
Preface hard questions with vulnerability to disarm the prospect.

"This might be a dumb question, but..." or "I don't know enough about your business yet to know if this is even relevant, but..."

This works because it lowers the prospect's guard and makes them want to help YOU understand. They end up sharing more.

### Justify Your Questions
Explain WHY you're asking before you ask, and tie it to their benefit.

"The reason I ask is so I can show you the most relevant examples when we get to the demo — who else are you evaluating besides [competitor]?"

### The "What Makes You Ask?" Pivot
When a prospect asks a specific question, don't answer immediately. Say:

"I can definitely answer that — but I'm curious, what makes you ask?"

This uncovers the real concern behind the question. They're thinking about a specific situation or problem that you might not discover any other way.

### Need Behind the Need
When someone states a surface-level need, peel the onion:

Surface: "We need more visibility into our pipeline."
Dig: "What's driving that? Help me understand what's happening when you don't have that visibility."
Deeper: "And when deals slip because of that, what does that mean for your revenue targets?"
Impact: "So you're looking at potentially missing your number by how much?"

### Hypothesis-Driven Discovery
Instead of open-ended questions, lead with a point of view:

"Based on what I've seen with companies like yours, I'd guess you're probably spending [X hours] per week on [task] manually. Am I close, or is it worse than that?"

This works better than "tell me about your challenges" because it shows expertise and gives them something concrete to react to.

## Finding Business Pain vs Technical Problems

This is the Gap Selling core principle. Stop obsessing over technical problems (clicks, spreadsheets, manual processes). Those are symptoms. You need the BUSINESS problem.

### The Problem Identification Chart (PIC)
Structure your discovery around three columns:
1. **Technical Problems** — what's broken in their current process
2. **Business Impact** — how those technical problems affect revenue, costs, time, risk
3. **Root Cause** — why the problem exists (this is where your solution fits)

### Moving from Technical to Business
When they say: "We spend too much time on [manual task]"
Don't say: "We can automate that!"
Instead say: "When your team is spending that time on [task], what are they NOT doing that they should be? What's the revenue impact of that?"

### Quantifying the Gap
The "gap" is the distance between their current state and their desired future state. Your job is to make that gap feel as large and painful as possible.

"So right now you're at [current state]. Where do you need to be? And what happens if you're still at [current state] six months from now?"

---

## Building Urgency & Loss Aversion

### The Cost of Inaction
Frame the conversation around what they're LOSING by not acting, not what they'll gain by buying.

"Every month you wait, you're essentially paying [X amount] in lost [revenue/efficiency/opportunities]. That's money that's gone — you can't get it back."

### Healthy Customer Tension
Don't let the prospect get comfortable with the status quo. Keep the tension alive by connecting their problems to consequences.

"You mentioned your team is spending 20 hours a week on [task]. That's 80 hours a month. At your team's loaded cost, that's roughly $X per month you're spending on something that shouldn't require human effort at all."

### The Competitor Frame
Even if the "competitor" is doing nothing, frame inaction as a competitive risk.

"Your competitors are already using AI to [do specific thing]. Every day you wait, that gap widens. The question isn't whether to adopt AI — it's whether you can afford to let them get further ahead."

### Emotional Amplification
After they share a problem, don't rush to solve it. Sit in the problem. Ask how it FEELS.

"When that happens, what does that mean for you personally? Are you the one staying late to fix it?"

---

## Demo Techniques

### The 5-Minute Harbor Tour
For discovery calls that flow into demos, do a quick "harbor tour" — just show the "so what," not the "how."

"Let me show you something quick — this is what it looks like when [specific problem they mentioned] just... goes away."

### Sell the 20%
Only demo the 20% of your product that solves their specific, stated problems. A demo is not a training session. It's not an IT evaluation. Show only what matters to THIS buyer.

### Continuous Discovery During Demo
After showing a feature, don't ask "any questions?" Instead:

"Based on what I just showed you, how does that compare to what you're doing today?"

This keeps them engaged and uncovers more pain you can address.

### Tie Every Feature to Impact
Never show a feature without explaining why it matters to THEM specifically.

"And that's important for you because you mentioned [specific problem]. This means [specific impact] — which based on what you told me is worth roughly [dollar amount or time savings]."

### The Before/After Frame
For AI demos specifically, show the contrast:

"Here's what your team is doing today — [manual process]. Here's what it looks like with an AI employee handling it. The difference is [time/money/quality]."

## Pricing Conversations

### Bring Up Price First
Never get asked "what does it cost?" — bring it up yourself. Professional sellers initiate the pricing conversation.

### The Floor + Range Method
"Our pricing starts at $500/month. For a company your size with the use cases we've been talking about, it typically lands in the $800-$1,200 range. There are a few factors that move it around. But before I get into those — what's your initial reaction to those numbers?"

### React to Their Reaction
Whatever they say, ask "why?" or "what makes you say that?"
- "Wow, that's more than I thought" → "Why? What were you expecting?" (uncovers budget constraints and gives you room to reframe value)
- "That seems reasonable" → "Why? Have you looked at similar solutions?" (uncovers competitive landscape)

### Anchor to Cost of Problem
When they push back on price: "I hear you. But let's go back to what you told me earlier — you're losing roughly [X] per month because of [problem]. The investment we're talking about is [fraction] of what the problem is costing you. The question is whether you can afford NOT to solve it."

### Popcorn Pricing (Decoy Effect)
If you have tiers, present three options where the middle one is the obvious choice. The expensive option makes the middle look reasonable. The cheap option looks like it's missing something important.

---

## Objection Handling

### Empathy + Education Pattern
1. Acknowledge the concern (don't dismiss it)
2. Ask "what makes you say that?" or "tell me more"
3. Reframe with education or a story from a similar customer

### Common Objections for AI Solutions

**"We're not ready for AI"**
→ "That's fair. Most of our customers said the same thing before they started. The ones who are seeing the biggest results actually started with something small — one specific process — and expanded from there. What if we just focused on [the one problem they mentioned]?"

**"It's too expensive"**
→ "Totally understand. Let me ask you this — you mentioned your team spends [X hours] on [task]. At your team's loaded cost, that's roughly $[amount] per month. The investment we're talking about is $[price]. So you'd be paying less than the problem costs. Does that math work for you?"

**"We want to build it ourselves"**
→ "I respect that. A lot of engineering teams feel that way. What I've seen though is that the build takes 6-12 months, costs 5-10x what you'd invest with us, and then someone has to maintain it. Our customers typically get live in 2-4 weeks. What does your timeline look like?"

**"I need to think about it"**
→ "Of course. Can I ask — what specifically do you need to think through? Is it the budget, the timing, or whether this is the right solution? I'd rather address whatever's on your mind now than have you go dark on me."

**"We're already using [competitor/alternative]"**
→ "Got it. How's that going for you? What's working well? And what, if anything, do you wish was different?"

## Closing & Next Steps

### The Five-Minute Drill
With 5 minutes left, drive toward commitment:

1. "Based on what we talked about, does this seem like something that could work for your team?"
2. "If we could get you set up within [timeframe], what would that look like on your end?"
3. "Who else would need to be involved in making this decision?"

### Set Concrete Next Steps
Never end with "I'll send you some info." Instead:

"Here's what I'd suggest as a next step — let's set up a 30-minute session where I can show you exactly what this would look like for [their specific use case]. I'll bring [specific deliverable]. Can we get that on the calendar for this week?"

### Create Urgency with Specificity
"We're onboarding 3 new clients this month and our implementation team books up fast. If we lock in a start date by [date], I can guarantee you'll be live within [timeframe]."

---

## Trust Building & Land-and-Expand

### Be Transparent About Weaknesses
If they ask about something you can't do well, say so. Trust is built on honesty.

"I want to be straight with you — that's not our strongest area. Where we really shine is [strength]. Would it make sense to start there and see the results before we tackle [weaker area]?"

### The Foot-in-the-Door Play
For $500-$1,500/month deals with 3-4 month minimums, the goal is to get started small and prove value fast.

"What if we start with just [one specific use case]? That way you see exactly what the AI can do with low risk. Most of our clients expand within 60 days because the results speak for themselves."

### Show Social Proof Naturally
Don't list logos. Tell specific stories.

"We worked with [similar company] who had the exact same problem. Within the first month, their [metric] improved by [X%]. I can connect you with them if you'd like to hear it firsthand."

### Build the Champion
Identify who on the prospect's side would benefit most from your solution and give them ammunition to sell internally.

"If you were going to pitch this to your boss, what would you need from me to make that easy? Let me put something together for you."

## AI-Specific Selling Angles

### The "Money Left on the Table" Frame
"Here's what I see with businesses like yours — you're running at maybe 60-70% of what's possible because there's a whole layer of work that humans are doing that AI should be handling. I'm talking about [specific tasks]. Every day that work stays manual, you're leaving money on the table."

### The Competitor Threat
"Your competitors are starting to deploy AI employees right now. The companies that move first get a compounding advantage — their AI gets smarter, their processes get tighter, and they pull further ahead every month. Where do you want to be in that race?"

### The ROI Math
Always bring it back to dollars:
"One AI employee at $1,000/month replaces roughly $[X] of human labor. It works 24/7, never calls in sick, and gets better over time. The math is pretty straightforward — you're looking at a [X]x return in month one."

### Address the Fear Factor
Many prospects are intimidated by AI. Normalize it.

"I get it — AI feels like a big leap. But here's the thing: this isn't sci-fi. It's automating the stuff your team hates doing anyway. They'll be relieved, not threatened. And you'll free them up to do the work that actually requires human judgment."

### The "You're Already Behind" Reframe
When someone says they're "exploring" or "not ready":

"Let me share what I'm seeing in the market. Six months ago, most companies were where you are — curious but cautious. Today, the early adopters are already on their second or third AI deployment. The gap between 'exploring' and 'too late' is closing faster than people expect."
