📍 CALL PHASE: Discovery (moving to Problem Building)

🔥 WHAT JUST HAPPENED
Sarah opened up about the real operational bottleneck: manual follow-up failures with retail partners are letting deals go cold, and content inconsistency is killing their marketing momentum. She's given you the gap — they know what SHOULD be happening but can't execute due to bandwidth constraints. This is gold.

💬 SAY THIS NEXT
"So follow-ups are dropping because it's coming down to you and your co-founder? That's the constraint." [Pause for confirmation]

"Here's what I'm seeing — you've got product-market fit starting to happen (retailers are interested, you're getting traction), but your sales and marketing infrastructure hasn't caught up. Most companies at your stage hit exactly this wall."

"When you lose a retailer because the follow-up was late, how much revenue are we talking about? Like, if you think about the last three months, how many retail partnerships fell apart because of follow-up timing?"

❓ ASK THIS
"When you say follow-ups are falling through the cracks — is that your team reaching out initially and not following up, or are they not doing the outreach at all?"

"If you had someone (or something) that could handle retail follow-ups on a consistent schedule, what would that free you up to do?"

⚠️ WATCH OUT
Don't pitch the solution yet. She's about to tell you the cost of inaction — make sure you quantify it. "We're too busy" is not a buying signal until you connect it to revenue loss and opportunity cost. Stay in the problem.

## COACHING NOTES (For Your Pause)

**Why this matters:** Sarah just handed you the **two-problem combo**:
1. **Sales inefficiency** — retail follow-ups dropping because there's no system
2. **Marketing inconsistency** — content posting is erratic because they're stretched

Both are solvable with an **AI Sales Rep** or **AI Marketing Agent** ($500-800/month), but you need to build the financial pain first.

**The setup for the close:**
- Quantify the lost revenue from cold retail leads
- Quantify the opportunity cost of inconsistent content (how many potential customers didn't see them because posts weren't consistent?)
- Connect it back to the core constraint: "You need an extra 20 hours a week of dedicated capacity without hiring"

**Next move after follow-up:**
Once she gives you numbers on lost retail deals, move to: "What if those follow-ups happened automatically on a schedule? Retailers would get touched 24 hours after initial interest. What would that be worth?"

That frames the AI as the obvious answer to the specific problem she just handed you.

## FORMAT FEEDBACK

**Strengths:**
✓ **Emoji headers are immediately scannable** — even on a call, Karkis can glance at 🔥 and know what just happened
✓ **"SAY THIS NEXT" is conversational** — not stiff scripting, sounds natural
✓ **ASK THIS section nails discovery sequencing** — first question validates the constraint, second uncovers the impact
✓ **WATCH OUT prevents common mistakes** — keeps him from pitching too early

**Minor friction points:**
- The format is tight, but could use one more optional layer: **"THE SETUP"** — a one-liner about what to listen for next (e.g., "Listen for: dollar amount of lost deals or timeline pressure")
- For longer calls, might want to add **📊 OPPORTUNITY SIZE** as a footer when the pain is quantifiable (e.g., "If 3 retail partners/month go cold = $X lost revenue")
- The COACHING NOTES section is great for *pauses*, but on a live call, it might be too much text. Consider collapsing it into a single **"PLAY YOU'RE SETTING UP"** bullet

**Scannability test:**
Read just the emoji + bold text. Can Karkis understand what to do in 5 seconds? YES.
- 📍 Discovery phase ✓
- 🔥 Retailers interested, follow-ups failing ✓
- 💬 Ask about the constraint, then the impact ✓
- ⚠️ Don't pitch yet ✓

**Verdict:** The format works. It's tight, specific, and designed for a live call where someone has 10 seconds to glance at coaching. The emoji system is non-cheesy and genuinely improves scannability. Karkis should be able to glance at each emoji section and know exactly what to say/ask without overthinking.
